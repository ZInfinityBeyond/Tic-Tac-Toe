# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Synopsis
Third Python Project
A basic terminal tic-tac-toe game which has 2 options, player vs. player and player vs. com.

#### What I learned
- Emphasized the importance of control flow. Already knew it but this definitely nailed it in due to home many factors were involved in coordinating it all together. 
- Emphasized the importance of good planning. Spent the beginning of this project making pseudocode to make sure I have everything down correctly which saved me many problems down the line. 

# Final Thoughts
Third and most likely final project with Python for now since I wanna do web-dev in the future. So imma focus learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I don't know if I did too much nesting in the beginning of my program but I'll fine that out and learn from it. 

Made this because I followed a tutorial when I was still learning that made this and couldn't understand it due to there programming style. Didn't make it a bad [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/#instructor-1), I just needed to it my way and here I am.
